# Horiseon--Challenge-1
Creating an accessible version of the Horiseon's website.
With the given website, I changed around different font sizes and colours to make reading easier for those with visual impairments. I added alt text descriptions for those who use screen readers. I changed the layout of the page by moving the benefits content box from the right to the bottom, to make the way the user would view the page flow better. I also added a hover function in the navbar so viewers can easily see which page they're about to click on. All other changed have been left in css comments.
